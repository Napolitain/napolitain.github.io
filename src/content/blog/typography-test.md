# Typography Test

This post serves as a **visual guide** to verify the styling of our blog. We want to ensure that *everything* looks perfect, from simple paragraphs to complex code blocks.

## Text Formatting

Here is a paragraph with some **bold text** to emphasize important points. We can also use *italics* for subtle emphasis. Sometimes, you might want to `highlight code inline` like this.

## Blockquotes

> "Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form."

Blockquotes should stand out from the rest of the text, perhaps with a border or a different background color.

## Code Blocks

Here is a code block showing some JavaScript:

```javascript
function calculateReadingTime(content) {
  const wordsPerMinute = 200;
  const words = content.trim().split(/\s+/).length;
  const minutes = Math.ceil(words / wordsPerMinute);
  return `${minutes} min read`;
}
```

And here is some CSS:

```css
.prose {
  max-width: 65ch;
  line-height: 1.75;
}
```

## Lists

### Unordered List
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item A
  - Sub-item B
- Item 3

### Ordered List
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Conclusion

This concludes our typography test. Hopefully, the **increased width** and **line spacing** make this a pleasure to read!
