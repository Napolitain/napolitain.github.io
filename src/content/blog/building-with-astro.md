# Building a Portfolio with Astro and Svelte

In this post, I'll share my experience building this portfolio site using modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro**: For static site generation and content management
- **Svelte**: For interactive components with minimal JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with utility-first approach

## Why Astro?

Astro offers the perfect balance between performance and developer experience. Its island architecture allows me to use Svelte components only where interactivity is needed, keeping the site fast and lightweight.

## Benefits

1. **Fast Load Times**: Static generation means instant page loads
2. **Developer Experience**: Great DX with hot module reloading
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to integrate different frameworks

## Conclusion

This stack has been a joy to work with, and I highly recommend it for similar projects!
